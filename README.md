# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹  

Well, if you want to know more about me, then visit the website instead...  

Isn't that the whole point of this repo? ðŸ˜†  

## But since you're here...  

**Who am I?**  
A software engineering student who dreams of working with embedded systems and IoT.  

**What do I do?**  
 âœ¦ Tinker with code and break things (then fix them... sometimes).  
 âœ¦ Have experience in **Discord bot coding** and **game development**.  
 âœ¦ Draw pixel art for my indie game.  Why? I'm broke and can't afford assets, so I make my own.  

**Fun fact:**  
I can communicate efficiently on a good day... but if something breaks? I speak fluent nonsense. 

Still reading? Wow. You must be truly determined.
